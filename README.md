## JABBA: Just Another Bayesian Biomass Assessment
The materials in this repository present the stock assessment tool ‘Just Another Bayesian Biomass Assessment’ JABBA. The motivation for developing JABBA was to provide a user-friendly R to JAGS (Plummer) interface for fitting generalized Bayesian State-Space SPMs with the aim to generate reproducible stock status estimates and diagnostics. Building on recent advances in optimizing the fitting procedures through the development of Bayesian state-space modelling approaches, JABBA originates from a continuous development process of a Bayesian State-Space SPM tool that has been applied and tested in many assessments across oceans. JABBA was conceived in the Summer of 2015 as a collaboration between the South Africa Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (NOAA) in Honolulu, HI USA. The goal was to provide a bridge between age-structured and biomass dynamic models, which are still widely used. JABBA runs quickly and by default generates many useful plots and diagnosic tools for stock assessments.

Inbuilt JABBA features include:

+ Integrated state-space tool for averaging multiple CPUE series (+SE) for optional use in assessments
+ Automatic fitting of multiple CPUE time series and associated standard errors
+ Fox, Schaefer or Pella Tomlinson production function (optional as input Bmsy/K)
+ Kobe-type biplot plotting functions 
+ Forecasting for alternative TACs 
+ Residual and MCMC diagnostics 
+ Estimating or fixing the process variance
+ Optional estimation additional observation variance for individual or grouped CPUE time series
+ Easy implementation of time-block changes in selectivity
